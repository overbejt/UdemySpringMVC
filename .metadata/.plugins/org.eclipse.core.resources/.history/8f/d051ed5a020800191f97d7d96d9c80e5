Look! I'm doing it!
</h1>

<p>
I will have to look and see if I can use css in the
jsp files.  It would be nice to use bootstrap again.  
But for now, I'm just messing around with things to 
see what works and what doesn't work.  
</p>

<p>
So far I have noticed a few things:
<ol>
<li>
White space does not matter in the jsp file.
I can break lines to make it easier to read the
file that I am working on, and it ignores the 
breaks when it runs in the browser.  
</li>
<li>
The html tags are valid.  They seem to work the 
same way that I'm used to.  
</li>
<li>
I want to look up what all is involved when using
css with a jsp file.  
</li>
<li>
I also want to see what all is involved with using
a database with Spring.
</li>
</ol>
